# Live Playground for Core Components

VueForge includes an interactive live playground route for core components:

- route: `/playground`

## What it includes

- tabbed playground for:
    - `Button`
    - `Input`
    - `Card`
    - layout primitives (`Stack` with preview cards)
- interactive controls for common prop/state combinations
- immediate preview updates while editing values

## Why use it

- validate visual and behavior changes quickly during development
- reproduce prop combinations before writing docs/examples
- smoke-check core theming and state variants with minimal setup

## Suggested workflow

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open `/playground`
3. Toggle props/states in controls panel
4. Mirror finalized combinations in component docs/recipes
