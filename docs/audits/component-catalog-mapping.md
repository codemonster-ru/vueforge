# Component Catalog Mapping

Last updated: 2026-02-25

Scope: parity, SaaS, layout, visualization, and catalog-delta coverage tracked in `CHECKLIST.md` (`P1.11`-`P1.16`).

Status legend:

- `Implemented`: exported from `src/index.ts` (or explicit functional equivalent).
- `In Checklist`: explicitly tracked in roadmap checklist.
- `Target Catalog`: appears in competitor catalogs (`Both`, `PrimeVue`, `Vuetify`, `No`).

Notes:

- Some `Vuetify` mappings are functional equivalents rather than one-to-one component names.
- `TreeView` and `ExpansionPanel` are parity targets backed by `Tree` and `Accordion` hardening, not separate v1 rendering cores.
- `Sidebar` and `Message` are alias-first scope items (`Drawer` and `InlineMessage`/`Alert`) and remain compatibility-focused in v1.
- This file is the source of truth for parity scope decisions (`implemented` / `deferred` / `not planned`).
- For future updates, re-run the same comparison workflow and update this table in the same PR as checklist changes.

Maintenance cadence:

- Run a full catalog sync at least once per month.
- Run a catalog sync before each versioned release.
- If target catalogs add new components, either add them to `CHECKLIST.md` or mark `not planned` with rationale in this file.

Duplicate-prevention rules:

- Prefer one canonical component per functional domain; avoid adding second components with equivalent behavior under different naming.
- If an alias/equivalent is required for migration or ecosystem familiarity, document: canonical target, API differences, and deprecation/migration path.
- Reject roadmap additions when behavior is already covered by an existing component unless there is a clear capability delta.

Potential overlap pairs (initial triage):

| Pair                                             | Recommended decision | Canonical target                                 | Criteria to keep both                                                                                             |

| ConfirmService + ConfirmPopup + ConfirmDialog    | Split                | ConfirmService + ConfirmPopup + ConfirmDialog    | Keep all three when UX intent differs: global blocking confirm vs anchor confirm vs modal confirm flow.           |
| Menu + TieredMenu                                | Alias                | Menu                                             | Keep both only if TieredMenu enforces strictly hierarchical keyboard model different from generic Menu.           |
| MenuBar + TabMenu                                | Split                | MenuBar + TabMenu                                | Keep both when one is command/navigation menu and another is route/section switcher with tab semantics.           |

| Toast + SnackbarQueue                            | Split                | Toast + SnackbarQueue                            | Keep both when queue orchestration is a separate policy layer, not a distinct visual component.                   |
| Popover + OverlayPanel                           | Alias                | Popover                                          | Keep both only if OverlayPanel preserves legacy API contract with deprecation path.                               |
| Drawer + Sidebar                                 | Alias                | Drawer                                           | Keep both only as temporary migration alias.                                                                      |

| Image + Galleria                                 | Split                | Image + Galleria                                 | Keep both when Galleria provides gallery-specific navigation/thumb/preview orchestration.                         |
| CodeBlock + CodeEditor + JSONViewer + DiffViewer | Split                | CodeBlock + CodeEditor + JSONViewer + DiffViewer | Keep all when each covers distinct read/write/structured/compare use cases.                                       |
| AppBar + Toolbar                                 | Split                | AppBar + Toolbar                                 | Keep both when AppBar is shell-level layout region and Toolbar is local action container.                         |
| BottomNavigation + TabMenu                       | Split                | BottomNavigation + TabMenu                       | Keep both when BottomNavigation is app-level nav pattern and TabMenu is in-page section navigation.               |
| ScrollTop + SpeedDial/FAB                        | Split                | ScrollTop + SpeedDial                            | Keep both when one is utility action and another is multi-action launcher.                                        |

Decision policy:

- Resolve each overlap pair before implementation starts for either component.
- Document final decision in PR description and keep this table updated.

V1 alias-first decisions (scope reduction):

| Alias name   | Canonical implementation for v1 | v1 action                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dropdown     | Select                          | Do not implement as separate component in v1; provide compatibility alias only if needed. |
| OverlayPanel | Popover                         | Do not implement separate rendering core in v1; map to Popover API subset.                |
| Sidebar      | Drawer                          | Keep as naming alias only; avoid duplicate implementation track.                          |
| Message      | InlineMessage/Alert             | Keep as docs-level naming guidance or lightweight alias, no separate behavior core.       |
| TieredMenu   | Menu                            | Start as Menu preset/API mode; split later only if clear behavior delta appears.          |

V1 split-required decisions (do not alias):

- `ConfirmService` / `ConfirmPopup` / `ConfirmDialog`
- `Select` / `Listbox`
- `SegmentedControl` / `ToggleButton`
- `AppBar` / `Toolbar`
- `Image` / `Galleria`
